# CZ4001-Virtual-and-Augmented-Reality
  Virtual and augmented reality is becoming a powerful technology for engineers to design and implement applications ranging from manufacturing and medical to media and entertainment. Virtual reality refers to techniques that build imaginary worlds in computers. Augmented reality adds cues by overlaying computer‚Äêgenerated images onto the real world. An understanding of the hardware, software and algorithms for virtual and augmented reality allows engineers like you to push the limits of the technology and develop useful applications. The prerequisite of this course is CZ2003 Computer Graphics and Visualization, which covers fundamentals of 3D modelling and animation.
